We will see this dataset again a little later from another R package  for plotting. For retrieving the results of the differential expression analysis, we will follow the tutorial (from Section 3.1) of the RNA-seq workflow. Specifically, we will load the [airway](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/airway.html) data, where different airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexamethasone. We will use this dataset to explore different visualisations for presenting differential abundance. While the data we will use are from an RNAseq experiment, we can utilise the same visualisations for other omics data such as proteomics or metabolomics after the relevant preprocessing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `{EnhancedVolcano}` R package ðŸ“¦ has been developed by [Kevin Blighe](https://www.biostars.org/u/41557/) - the name might seem familiar as you might have come across it several times if you find yourselves in [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/u/41557/) frequently. Kevin Blighe, is not merely a very active Biostars users but also the admin! The `{EnhancedVolcano}` R package, is one very useful R package, as it provides great flexibility and ease for creating publication ready Volcano plots. We will be following the package `vignette`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano), in the respective GitHub repository.Let's see the package in action!"
